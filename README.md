Parallel Kingdom MOD
======
This is a MOD for the Android's version of client for popular game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silvermoon.client"><b>Parallel Kingdom MMO</b> by PerBlue</a>.
The base of this project is <a href="https://github.com/Ingress-apk-mod/ingress-apk-mod">Ingress "broot" mod</a> (thanks guys)

The purpose of this mod is to make game process more fun by reducing the level of tediousness of some processes and introducing some unique features which devs refuse to implement.

Map is not working due to the reason that app uses V1 of Google MAP API which is deprecated so I can't generate new API-key for my signing certificate. I really doubt that I can make it work. But who needs that map anyway, right? :)
